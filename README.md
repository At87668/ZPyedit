We try to develop for you a lightweight python development platform !
And we will be part of the open source! 
It USES the MIT license, you can call it, and you just need to mention we!
Of course, you can also directly copy our code, we don't care, but you must have a sense of shame.
                                                                            --At87668 and his team
